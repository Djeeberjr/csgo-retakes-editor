# CS:GO Retakes card editor

A little helper to cusomize the CS:GO gamemode "Retakes". 
I recommend reading the [official wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/CS:GO_Game_Mode_-_Retakes) first. 

You can export the created decks to convars in order to use them inside your server or export them to JSON to edit the later. 
The decks can also be saved localy in the browser so you dont have to worry about losing your work.

This project is deployed at Github Pages here: [https://djeeberjr.github.io/csgo-retakes-editor/](https://djeeberjr.github.io/csgo-retakes-editor/)
